Drop this file in your root of the game directory

Example:
C:\Games\amfa_episode015_v04-0.4-pc\

I have created a Multi-Mod with walkthrough for A Heartfelt Visit by Secret Arcade

Mod Features:
  1. Custom Cheat Menu to modify variables and stats.
  2. Walkthough with Suggestions. With Certain scripts overwritten.
  3. When a custom script is active the options to save will be disabled and restored once a custom script is done.
  4. Custom Replays with Navigation by Character or Episode.
  5. Music Player with In-Game Overlay
  6. In-Game Mod shortcuts button "?" Just above Music Player Overlay
  7. Modified Characters to reinclude the textbox. Can be toggled off.
  8. Toggle between standard Notifications of Stack Notifications
  9. Fadeable text with options to change to suit you preference
  10. Custom Savenames
  11. Hotkeys for choice menus
  12. and more...

Every option can be toggled in preferences

Have tested that if you remove mod saves still work even if a save was made while the mod was installed.

The mod works without modifying any of the original files so theoretically it should not affect saves.

The other options should work without a hitch but will be tested on every release.

If a new version is released the walkthrough will be out of sync. But it will not affect the way the game
plays. None of the original files is touched.

If there is an internet connection available the mod will check if updates available.

Drop the contents into game folder

If the mod is installed correctly it will show on the main menu mod installed

The Current Mod Version is **0.4**
